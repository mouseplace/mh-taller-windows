# 🐭️ MouseHunt - Taller windows

A Userscript for [MouseHunt](https://mousehuntgame.com) that makes all the windows taller, so you can see more of the content without scrolling.

> [!TIP]
> You should install [MouseHunt Improved](https://github.com/MHCommunity/mousehunt-improved) instead of this script, as it includes this functionality and tons more!


## Installation

Install via [GreasyFork](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/452235-mousehunt-taller-windows).
